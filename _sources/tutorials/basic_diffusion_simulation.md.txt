# Tutorial 1: Basic Diffusion Simulation

Let us tackle the basic diffusion equation as applied to steady state heat
transfer on a 3D orthogonal mesh.

$$
-\nabla \cdot k \nabla T = q
$$

The purpose of this tutorial is to understand the basics of the
input paradigm which is completely different from the traditional
input-card based method.
OpenSn uses an embedded Lua console. For a history of Lua please see its
wikipedia page
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)">here</a>.
This paradigm allows the user to control many aspects of the program flow
as well to be more versatile when creating inputs, i.e. reading files, for
loops to create multiple entities etc. So let us get started.

## Step 1 - Create your input file, open it in a text editor

Go to the directory of your choosing and make an input file of your choosing.
The input file does not require a specific .lua or .inp extension although if you use .lua then
there are many text editors that will be able to provide syntax highlighting.

## Step 2 - Create a mesh handler

```
chiMeshHandlerCreate()
```

This function call creates a new mesh handler and pushes it to a global
stack. It also makes the newly created handler the "current" meaning all
mesh operations will operate on this handler.
The concept of creating, reading or manipulating computational meshes is
centered on operating on a specific `chi_mesh::MeshHandler` object. Physics/math
objects can then freely operate on meshes by simply specifying which handler
to use.

## Step 3 - Create a 3D mesh

For this we will create a simple orthogonal grid of 32x32x32 cells
(32,768 total) as shown in Figure 1.

```{figure} /images/meshing/cube_mesh_tut1.png

Figure 1 - Mesh spanning from [-1,-1,-1] to [1,1,1]
```

The first step of this process is to define an array of nodes starting from -1.0
with a distance \f$ ds \f$ between each of them. In lua we can create this array
programatically:

```
nodes={}
N=32
ds=2.0/N
for i=0,N do
    nodes[i+1] = i*ds
end
```

Note here that lua arrays cannot use `nodes[0]` since arrays in lua are not
zero based. The next step is call `chiMeshCreateUnpartitioned3DOrthoMesh` with
the node arrangement along the X-direction, Y-direction and Z-direction,
which in our case is the same,

```
surf_mesh, region1 = chiMeshCreateUnpartitioned3DOrthoMesh(nodes,nodes,nodes)
```

Some work has been encapsulated behind the scenes here. Firstly, a 2D surface
mesh was created and assigned to a region.
Secondly a surface-mesher (`chi_mesh::SurfaceMesher`)
and a volume mesher (`chi_mesh::VolumeMesher`) has been
assigned to the mesh handler. The volume mesher is not executed because the
macro allows the user to first assign parallel partitioning.

## Step 4 -  Executing the mesher

The underlying mesher for a 3D mesh is an extruded mesh from 2D. This mesh
has some partitioning properties that can be set to allow parallel simulations,
however, we will just focus on serial simulations for now.
The next step to complete meshing is to execute the volume mesher. Since we
are not going to set any partitioning parameters we will just execute it now.

```
chiVolumeMesherExecute();
```

## Step 5 - Assign material- and boundary IDs and

Materials ID's can conveniently be specified using logical volumes. There are
many options for logical volumes ranging from primitive parametric surfaces
to non-convex user generated surfaces using surface meshes
(see `chiLogicalVolumeCreate`). For this tutorial
we will use a rectangular paralellipiped (RPP or brick) as follows.

```
material = chiPhysicsAddMaterial("Test Material");

vol0 = chiLogicalVolumeCreate(RPP,-1000,1000,-1000,1000,-1000,1000)
chiVolumeMesherSetProperty(MATID_FROMLOGICAL,vol0,material)
```

We first create a material using the `chiPhysicsAddMaterial()` function.
The handle of this material will essentially be zero but it is not technically
required by the `chiVolumeMesherSetProperty()` function since this function
operates on the integer supplied.
This material is added to the physics environment and therefore has scope over
all mesh handlers and all physics entities. We then create a logical volume
using the function `chiLogicalVolumeCreate()` with arguments RPP,
specifying that we will be using a Rectangular Parallelipiped and then a
series of dimensions specifying xmin-xmax-ymin-ymax-zmin-zmax. Every cell
centroid within these dimensions will be flagged as being "within" the logical
volume.

Actually setting the mesh's material id's is a utility facilitated by a
volume mesher property and hence we call `chiVolumeMesherSetProperty()`
with a property index MATID_FROMLOGICAL. Next we provided a handle to the
logical volume (vol0) and the desired material id. Logical volumes are very
diverse and their uses are discussed elsewhere. There is an additional utility,
`chiVolumeMesherSetMatIDToAll()`, which will set all cell-material-ids without
requiring a logical volume, however, in this tutorial we opted to show the
logical volume route.

### Boundary IDs

By default, all boundaries are unassigned (i.e., -1). There are two utilities
that set the boundary id's the first of which is essentially identical to how
material ids are set, `chiVolumeMesherSetProperty()`, but this time the property
index is `BNDRYID_FROMLOGICAL`. The second way is to use
`chiVolumeMesherSetupOrthogonalBoundaries()` which requires no arguments and will
assign standard indices to a boundary if it is aligned with the orthogonal
cartesian directions.

The culmination of this step is all done within a physics agnostic framework.
The user can even export the mesh for visualization using the function
`chiMeshHandlerExportMeshToObj()`.

### Boundary IDs


## Step 5 - Adding material properties

Now that the cells have been assigned a material id we need to add
properties to the material conducive to a diffusion simulation. For a heat
transfer diffusion simulation we will need to know the thermal conductivity
"k" and the volumetric source strength "q". Both of these can be simple
scalar values.

```
chiPhysicsMaterialAddProperty(material,SCALAR_VALUE,"k")
chiPhysicsMaterialSetProperty(material,"k",SINGLE_VALUE,1.0)

chiPhysicsMaterialAddProperty(material,SCALAR_VALUE,"q")
chiPhysicsMaterialSetProperty(material,"q",SINGLE_VALUE,1.0)
```

In this code we created the material properties using the function
`chiPhysicsMaterialAddProperty()` which requires a handle to the reference
material, the property type (`SCALAR_VALUE`), and a name for the property.
Unlike extrusion layers the property name can be used in further calls to refer
to the specific property.

Material property values are set using the function
`chiPhysicsMaterialSetProperty()` which again expects a handle to the
reference material, then either a material property id or name (in this case
name), then an operation index and value(s). For this case we used an operation
index `SINGLE_VALUE` which is the only operation supported by `SCALAR_VALUE`. In
future the user can specify, as an example, temperature dependent values which
will support the operation `FROM_TABLE`, but that is a topic for a different time.

## Step 6 - Set up the diffusion physics

The following sequence of function calls completely define the diffusion solver.

```
phys1 = chiDiffusionCreateSolver()
chiSolverSetBasicOption(phys1,"discretization_method","PWLC")
chiSolverSetBasicOption(phys1,"residual_tolerance",1.0e-6)
```

We first create the diffusion solver with a call to
`chiDiffusionCreateSolver()`. This creates the solver and pushes it onto
the physics handler. The function returns the handle.

Next we can set numerous diffusion solver properties which can comprehensively
be viewed in its specific documentation (`chiDiffusionSetProperty()`).

## Step 7 - Initialize and Solve

The final step of this process is to initialize and execute the diffusion solver.

```
chiDiffusionInitialize(phys1)
chiDiffusionExecute(phys1)
```

## Step 8 - Post-processing

The execution of a OpenSn physics module culminates in the creation of one or
more field functions. These field functions should all be populated for use
during the initialization phase of the solver. Users can get handles to all
the field functions by using the `chiSolverGetFieldFunctionList` call. Thereafter, the
field function can be exported to VTK-format which can be read by Paraview.

```
fflist,count = chiSolverGetFieldFunctionList(phys1)
chiExportFieldFunctionToVTK(fflist[1],"Tutorial1Output","Temperature")
```
